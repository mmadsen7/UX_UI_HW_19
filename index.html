        <h1>I'm Mikaela</h1>
        <p>I'm a UX/UI Designer and Graphic Designer. I've lived all over the U.S. and Canada but, I currently call beautiful Utah home. I love spending time outside in nature to balance out all my screen time. I love art, color, music, design, and typography. I enjoy reading, writing, copy editing, and researching. I love interviewing people and learning about their stories and experiences and designing solutions to solve their problems.</p>

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>I was on the Journalism staff in middle school and high school and I later got a Minor in Journalism in University. Journalism taught me strong communication, presentation, and interpersonal skills.
          It also created a love for interviewing people and learning about their stories and experiences. I find it satisfing that through UX Design I can create solutions 
          to solve user problems. </p>

        <h3>Design Thinking</h3>
        <p>I love working iteratively through all phases of the design process from ideation to solution. I enjoy taking the quantitative and qualitative data I find through research, analyzing the data and identifying user pain points to then create design goals to solve the user's needs. </p>

        <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
        <p>My background and degree is in Art and Graphic Design, so I enjoy making the user's visual experience a priority. Beautiful, crisp and concise design gets me excited. I believe great UI Design is functional, reliable, accessible, and delightful to use.</p>
